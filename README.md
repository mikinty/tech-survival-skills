## Basics

- Typing (WPM > 100): if you can't type fast...you're just shooting yourself in the foot
- `git` or some sort of version control will make sure your work is organized for yourself and for others

## Terminal

- Basic commands
  - navigation like `ls`, `cd`
  - `curl`
- `vim`: keeping your hands at home will drastically increase your WPM for work. VSCode is honestly find these days as well, but `vim` is still great for coding.
- `tmux`: keeping your dev env in terminal can potentially reduce time switching windows. Also keeping sessions alive is very useful, and organizing your workspace to your needs can help you.

## Presentation

- LaTeX: If you are a tech person, knowing how to typeset documents with code and make prettier documents than other people will put you ahead of your peers.
- Learn how to use powerpoint or keynote to make presentations with decent diagrams. Your work isn't known unless other people hear about it and understand it. Presentations are the best way to get the word out, and clearly.
